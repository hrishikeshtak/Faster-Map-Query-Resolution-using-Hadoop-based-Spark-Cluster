# Faster-Map-Query-Resolution-using-Hadoop-based-Spark-Cluster
This is my M-Tech Project , this project contains the Map query resolutions using Spark cluster .

## Getting Started

### 1. Creation of Network

    a) Wireless Ad-Hoc network :
    
        First read the PDF "Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wireless-ad-hoc-network.pdf" and 
        then run script "Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wireless-ad-hc-network/ad_hoc_client.sh" 
        on one machine and run script "Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wireless-ad-hc-network/
        ad_hoc_server.sh" on another machine .

    b) Wired network :
        
        For creation of wired network , it required the machines are connected through LAN cable or Router
        or Switch .

### 2. Proxy Server or Network Address Translator (NAT) :
        
        First read the PDF NAT-or-Proxy-server-setup/Nat-or-proxy-server.pdf
        [PDF](https://github.com/hrishikeshtak/Faster-Map-Query-Resolution-using-Hadoop-based-Spark-Cluster/blob/master/NAT-or-Proxy-server-setup/Nat-or-proxy-server.pdf)
    
### 3. Hadoop Single Node :

        Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows to store and process big data in a distributed 
        environment across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
        To setup Hadoop single node on your linux based machine , check the "Hadoop-Single-Node-Setup"
