# Faster-Map-Query-Resolution-using-Hadoop-based-Spark-Cluster

This is my M-Tech Project , this project contains the Map query resolutions using Spark cluster .

## Getting Started

### 1. Creation of Network

####a) Wireless Ad-Hoc network :                           
First read the PDF [Creation-of-wireless-ad-hoc-network.pdf](Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wireless-ad-hoc-network.pdf)            
and then run script from [Creation-of-wireless-ad-hoc-network](Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wireless-ad-hoc-network/)

####b) Wired network :        
For creation of wired network, it required the machines are connected    
through LAN cable or Router or Switch . Check the directory
[Creation-of-wired-network]( Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/Creation-of-wired-network/)

### 2. Proxy Server or Network Address Translator (NAT) :   
First read the [Nat-or-proxy-server.pdf](NAT-or-Proxy-server-Setup/Nat-or-proxy-server.pdf) and then check the directory [NAT-or-Proxy-server-Setup](NAT-or-Proxy-server-Setup/)

### 3. Hadoop Single Node :
Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows to store and process   
big   data in a distributed environment across clusters of computers using  
simple programming models.To setup Hadoop single node on your linux    
based machine , check the directory [Hadoop-Single-Node-Setup](Hadoop-Single-Node-Setup/)
       
### 4. Hadoop Multi Node Cluster :              
To setup Hadoop multi node cluster , we required at least two machines    
( one is master and one is slave ) , and they need to be in same network.   
To create our own subnet first check the directory  [Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network](Creation-of-Ad-Hoc-Network/) , 
then check the directory [Hadoop-Multi-Node-Setup](Hadoop-Multi-Node-Setup/)

### 5. Hadoop Wordcount Example : 
To check that our Hadoop cluster is successfully installed or not, run the     
hadoop wordcount example . Go to [Hadoop-wordcount-example](Hadoop-wordcount-example/) 
        
### 6. Spark Setup :
Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. 
check the directory [Spark-Setup](Spark-Setup/)

### 7. OpenStreetMap :            
 OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. OpenStreetMap, the project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. 
check the directory [OpenStreetMap](OpenStreetMap/)

### 8. Level-of-detail :
 level of detail involves decreasing the complexity of a 3D object representation as it moves away from the viewer or according to other metrics such as object importance, viewpoint-relative speed or position.
check the directory [ Level-of-detail]( Level-of-detail/)
